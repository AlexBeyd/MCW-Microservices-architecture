# Microservices Architecture

Contoso Events is an online service for concerts, sporting and other event ticket sales. They are redesigning their solution for scale with a microservices strategy and want to implement a POC for the path that receives the most traffic: ticket ordering.

## Target Audience

- Application developer
- Infrastructure architect

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will look at the process of developing a proof of concept (POC) that will illustrate the use of many Azure features to support a highly scalable microservices architecture based on Service Fabric and Azure Functions. 

By the end of this workshop you will be better able to design and deploy solutions based on Service Fabric and Azure Functions - in conjunction with other Azure features.

### Whiteboard Design Session

This whiteboard design session is designed to help attendees gain a better understanding of implementing architectures leveraging aspects from microservices and serverless architectures, by helping an online concert ticket vendor survive the first 5 minutes of crushing load. They will handle the client's scaling needs through microservices built on top of Service Fabric, and apply smooth updates or roll back failing updates. Finally, students will design an implementation of load testing to optimize the architecture for handling spikes in traffic.

At end end of this whiteboard design session, you will better be able to design scalable microservices solutions involving Service Fabric and Azure Functions.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end POC for ticket ordering based on a microservices architecture based on Service Fabric and Azure Functions - alongside other supporting Azure features such as API Management, Web Apps, Azure Active Directory and Cosmos DB.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will better be able to build solutions that leverage these Azure features, in addition to gaining experience with deploying, scaling, upgrading and rolling back Service Fabric applications.
